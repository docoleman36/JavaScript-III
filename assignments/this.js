/* The for principles of "this";
 * in your own words. explain the four principle for the "this" keyword below.
 *
 * 1. The first principle is the window/ global object binding. When calling "this" it is on the window object only.
 * 2. Implicit Binding is used om function and is called by everything that is left of a preceding dot.
 * 3. New binding is an object constructor that returns a object.
 * 4. Explicit binding is when we use a method to explicitly bind the this keyword.
 *
 * write out a code example of each explanation above
